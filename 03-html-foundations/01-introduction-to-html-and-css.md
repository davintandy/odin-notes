# Introduction to HTML and CSS

Every website you visit is built using these two fundamental languages. While they work together, they have very different jobs.

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

**”The Skeleton”** HTML is the raw data and structure of your webpage. It’s used to define the actual content that appears on the screen.

- **Elements include:** Text, links, images, buttons, and lists.
- **Purpose:** To give the page substance and hierarchy.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

**”The Skin & Style”** CSS is the layer of design that sits on top of your HTML. Without it, the web would look like a giant Word document from 1995.

- **Controls:** Colors, fonts, spacing (padding/margins), and animations.
- **Purpose:** To position information and make it visually engaging.

## Quick Comparison

| **Feature** | **HTML** | **CSS** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Role** | Structure & Content | Presentation & Layout |
| **Example** | `<h1>Hello World</h1>` | `h1 { color: blue; }` |
| **Focus** | “What is on the page?” | “How does it look?” |

Always write your HTML first to ensure your content makes sense structurally, then bring in CSS to make it beautiful.
